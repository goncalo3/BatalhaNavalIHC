#### Client to Server Messages

The client can send the following message types to the server:

| Message Type | Description                            | Payload                                                |
|------------- |----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------- |

| `join_queue` | Request to join the matchmaking queue  | No additional payload                                  |
| `leave_queue`| Request to leave the matchmaking queue | No additional payload                                  |
| `ships_data` | Send ship placement information        | `{ ships: Ship[] }` - Array of ship objects            |
| `attack`     | Make an attack on the opponent's board | `{ x: number, y: number }` - Coordinates of the attack |
| `join_friend`| Join a specific friend's game          | `{ friend_id: string }` - ID of the friend to join     |

#### Data Structures

**Ship Object**
```typescript
{
  posX: number;         // X-coordinate of ship's starting position
  posY: number;         // Y-coordinate of ship's starting position
  length: number;       // Length of the ship
  isHorizontal: boolean; // Orientation of the ship: true if horizontal, false if vertical
  hits: { x: number; y: number }[] | null; // Track hits on the ship by recording positions

}
```
**Player Object**
```typescript
interface Player {
  ws: WebSocket;             // Player's WebSocket connection
  opponent: Player | null;   // Opponent player, null if not in a game
  isMyTurn: boolean;         // Flag to indicate if it's this player's turn
  ships: Ship[];             // Array of ships placed by this player
  id: string;                // Unique WebSocket session ID for the player
  userId?: number;           // Database user ID (if authenticated)
  username?: string;         // Username (if authenticated)
  gameSessionId?: number;    // Database game session ID
  gameStartTime?: Date;      // Game start time
}
```

#### Game Flow

1. **Connection**: Client connects to server with a WebSocket
2. **Matchmaking**: Client sends `join_queue` to enter matchmaking
3. **Game Start**: When two players are matched, both receive `start_game` notification
4. **Ship Placement**: Both players send `ships_data` with their ship placements
5. **Gameplay**: Players take turns making attacks with `attack` messages
   - After each attack, both players receive appropriate notifications
   - Ships that are fully hit are marked as destroyed
6. **Game End**: When all ships of one player are destroyed, the game ends
   - Winner receives `you_win`
   - Loser receives `you_lose`

#### Ship Validation Rules

When sending `ships_data`, the ship placement must follow these rules:

**Ship Configuration (exactly 5 ships required):**
- 1 Carrier (length 5)
- 1 Battleship (length 4)
- 1 Cruiser (length 3)
- 1 Submarine (length 3)
- 1 Destroyer (length 2)

**Placement Rules:**
- Ships must be placed within the 10x10 game board (coordinates 0-9)
- Ships cannot overlap with each other
- Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically only
- Each ship must fit entirely within the board boundaries

If ship validation fails, the server will respond with `ships_validation_error` containing a descriptive error message. Valid ship placements will receive a `ships_accepted` confirmation.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Users Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `username` - Unique username
- `email` - Unique email
- `password_hash` - Bcrypt hashed password
- `created_at` - Registration timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

### Game Sessions Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `player1_id` - First player (foreign key to Users table)
- `player2_id` - Second player (foreign key to Users table)
- `winner_id` - Winner (foreign key to Users table, nullable)
- `loser_id` - Loser (foreign key to Users table, nullable)
- `game_duration_seconds` - Game duration in seconds
- `started_at` - Game start timestamp
- `ended_at` - Game end timestamp
- `game_status` - Enum: 'active', 'completed', 'abandoned'

### User Stats View
(This is typically a view or calculated dynamically)
Automatically calculated statistics for each user:
- `wins` - Number of wins
- `losses` - Number of losses
- `total_games` - Total completed games
- `win_percentage` - Win rate percentage
- `avg_win_duration` - Average duration of won games

## üîß Environment Variables
```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000                 # The port the server will run on
DEBUG=true                # Enable/disable debug logging

# Database Configuration (ensure these are set for database functionality)
DB_HOST=localhost         # Database host
DB_PORT=3306              # Database port
DB_USER=root              # Database username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password # Database password
DB_NAME=battleship_game   # Database name

# JWT Configuration (ensure these are set for authentication)
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here # Secret key for signing JWTs
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h                  # JWT expiration time (e.g., 1h, 7d)
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt (typically 10 rounds or more) before storing in the database.
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure JSON Web Tokens are used for session management and API authentication, with configurable expiration times.
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use of parameterized queries or ORMs that inherently protect against SQL injection when interacting with the database.
- **Authentication Required**: Sensitive operations and user-specific data access require valid JWT authentication.

## üìä Game Statistics Features

- **Game History Tracking**: A history of completed games is kept.
- **Leaderboard System**: A public leaderboard shows top players based on wins and losses.
- **Comprehensive Game Session Logging**: Details of each game (players, duration, outcome) are logged in the database.
